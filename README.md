# Translator
This translator can be used for Pep/9. 
The first stage is inputting a string of terminals into the lexical analyzer. 
Then the output of the lexical analyzer and the input of the parser are a stream of tokens. 
The output of the parser is a program in a low level language. 
That low level language then gets inputted into the code generator which outputs the object code.
